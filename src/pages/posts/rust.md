It makes sense to take a different path and try the Rust language. My expectations are divergent; it's really hard to learn and apply quickly. However, I found this framework called Locomotive, and although it's complex, I think it makes it easier for new users to implement Rust. They say it's like Ruby on Rails, which makes it really easy to apply early on. I also think it's more effective for learning compared to using Rust on its own. They have a tutorial ready and applicable. I think I will try it at another time.
